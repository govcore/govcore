/*
 * This rule is needed to provide Cook County Admin's green focus outline. There is a style
 * in the CKEditor module CSS that adds a box-shadow at a higher specificity
 * than Cook County Admin's focus outline styling. This is added at one higher degree of
 * specificity.
 * @see core/modules/ckeditor/css/ckeditor.admin.css
