The powerful Drupal distribution for local government. Brought to you by [Clarity Partners](https://www.claritypartners.com/).

GovCore is an enhanced Drupal distribution with a lot of necessities.
Necessities are all the modules, features, configurations that we include
in every project.


## It's made with the following benefits in mind:

* Speeds up development.
* Offers standardized configuration and best-practices.
* Comes with a lot of needed functionalities/modules for a government Drupal site.

Starting a new project? Consider GovCore for Drupal 9.
Installing GovCore 9.0.x comes with several extra automated installation
steps, to take full advantage of GovCore, other than the Drupal 9 installation
instructions.


# Install with Composer

To install the most recent stable release of GovCore 9.0.x run this command:
```
composer create-project govcore/govcore-project:^9.0.0 PROJECT_DIR_NAME --no-dev --no-interaction
```

To install the dev version of GovCore 9.0.x run this command:
```
composer create-project govcore/govcore-project:9.0.x-dev PROJECT_DIR_NAME --stability dev --no-interaction
```
